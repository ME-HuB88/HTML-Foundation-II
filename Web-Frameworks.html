      <h3>What are web application frameworks?</h3>

        <p><strong>Web Application Frameworks </strong>or<strong> Web Frameworks </strong> are <em>“software framework that are designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs”.</em> In simple words, web frameworks are a piece of software that offers a way to create and run web applications. Instead of writing every part of an application from scratch, developers can use these frameworks to handle repetitive tasks, such as URL routing, database interaction, session management, security, and form validation.</p>

        <p>In earlier days of web app development, web frameworks were introduced as a means to end hand-coding of applications where just the developer of a particular app could change it. That was long ago, now we have web-specific languages and the trouble with changing an app’s structure is resolved because of the arrival of a general performance. Now, depending upon your task you may choose one web framework that fulfills all your requirements or converges multiple frameworks.</p><br>

      <h3>Features of Web Application Frameworks:</h3>

        <p>Web application frameworks offer a range of features that help simplify and streamline the development of web applications. Below are some of the key features that most frameworks provide:</p>

          <ol>
            <strong><li>Routing:</li></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Maps URLs to specific functions or controllers.</li>
                <li>Allows clean, SEO-friendly URLs.</li>
                <li>Provides flexibility in defining how different endpoints behave.</li><br> 
              </ul>
            
            <strong><li>Templating Engine:</li></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Enables the dynamic generation of HTML content by embedding data into templates.</li>
                <li>Facilitates separating logic from presentation (MVC—Model View Controller pattern).</li>
                <li>Common templating engines include Jinja2 (for Python), Blade (for Laravel), and EJS (for Express.js).</li><br>
              </ul> 
            
            <strong><li>Database Abstraction (ORM):</li></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) systems allow developers to interact with databases using programming languages instead of raw SQL queries.</li>
                <li>Automatically generates SQL queries, reducing the chance for errors.</li>
                <li>Examples include Django ORM (Python), Active Record (Rails), and Eloquent (Laravel).</li><br> 
              </ul> 
              
            <strong><li>Session and State Management:</li></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Handles user authentication and session persistence.</li>
                <li>Manages cookies, user logins, and other stateful interactions.</li>
                <li>Often integrated with security features to protect sensitive data.</li><br> 
              </ul> 
              
            <strong><li>Security:</li></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection</li>
                <li>XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Prevention</li>
                <li>SQL Injection Prevention</li>
                <li>Authentication & Authorization systems to control access to resources.</li><br> 
              </ul> 
                
            <strong><li>API Support:</li></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Many frameworks make it easy to create RESTful APIs or GraphQL endpoints for enabling communication between frontend and backend.</li>
                <li>They often provide utilities for serializing and deserializing data formats like JSON or XML.</li><br> 
              </ul> 
                
            <strong><li>Real-time Communication:</li></strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Some frameworks support real-time communication using technologies like WebSockets, allowing applications to push updates to clients in real time (e.g., chat applications, live notifications).</li><br> 
              </ul> 
          </ol>

      <h3>Types of Web Frameworks</h3>

        <p>As web standards began to advance, the app logic shifted towards the client- ensuring smarter communication between the user and the web application. With logic on client-side, they (client) can react swiftly to user input. This makes web apps more responsive, easily navigate-able on any device. Thus, we have two functions of frameworks:
 
          <ol>
            <strong><li>Back-end:Server-side Frameworks:</li></strong>
              <p>The rules and architecture of the server-side frameworks permit you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different kinds. To create a web application with a well-developed interface you need a wider range of functionality. Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc. These frameworks can improve security and form the output data- simplifying the development process.</p>

              <p>Client-side frameworks don’t take care of the business logic like the server-side ones. They function inside the browser. Therefore, you can enhance and implement new user interfaces. A number of animated features can be created with frontend and single page applications. Every client-side framework varies in functionality and use.</p>

Because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.[9][10] A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.
